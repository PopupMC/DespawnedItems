## Despawned Items

**In the process of doing a rewrite**

When complete it will be much more powerful and flexible

* Cleaner Code
* Flexibility to despawn items into more than chests and barrels
* Ability to despawn fuel items into furnaces, blast furnaces, smokers etc... and smeltable items into them as well if they can be smelted/cooked in it
* Auto removal of items that should not be despawned into stuff
* Expandability to easily add more items to intelligently despawn items into
* Ownership of despawn locations meaning regular players can manage despawn items themselves
* Limitations of despawn locations per player
* Ability for admins to lookup locations filtered by owner
* Ability for admins or players to auto purge certain items from their own or others or all (with correct permissions)

About 90% done

-----------------------

Despawned Items go into added chests or barrels. (Barrels have higher client-side FPS, chests can ruin FPS)

Normally I would fill out a lot of into here but this is an internal plugin
so maybe later.
